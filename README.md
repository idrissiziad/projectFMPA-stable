# projectFMPA: A Medical School Multiple-Choice Question Bank

## Description

This project is a community-driven initiative from a student to create a high-quality, open-source question bank of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for medical students. Our goal is to provide a free and accessible resource to supplement medical education and aid in exam preparation. The questions cover a wide range of medical subjects and are designed to test foundational knowledge and clinical reasoning. [3]

This resource is intended for:
*   Medical students preparing for examinations.
*   Educators seeking supplementary materials for their curriculum.
*   Anyone interested in self-assessment of medical knowledge for educational purposes.
